# The Annotated Encoder Decoder with Attention

Recently, Alexander Rush wrote a blog post called [The Annotated Transformer](http://nlp.seas.harvard.edu/2018/04/03/attention.html), describing the Transformer model from the paper [Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762). This post can be seen as a **prequel** to that: *we will implement an Encoder-Decoder with Attention* using (Gated) Recurrent Neural Networks, very closely following the original attention-based neural machine translation paper [\"Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473) of Bahdanau et al. (2015).

The idea is that going through both blog posts will make you familiar with two very influential sequence-to-sequence architectures. If you have any comments or suggestions, please let me know on Twitter [@joostbastings](https://twitter.com/joostbastings) or e-mail me at *firstname dot lastname @ gmail dot com*."

Read the [blog post](https://bastings.github.io/annotated_encoder_decoder/) or simply run the jupyter notebook from this repository.
